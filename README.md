# Istanbul Rental Price Prediction

In this project, I collected rental price data for Istanbul by performing web scraping from the EmlakJet website. Based on the assumption that the minimum rent in Istanbul is at least 9,000 TL, I set the minimum value in the dataset to 9,000 TL.

Using the collected data, I developed models to predict rental prices. These models were created using both Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. The goal of this study is to analyze the predictability of rental prices in Istanbul and explore methods to improve the accuracy of these predictions.
